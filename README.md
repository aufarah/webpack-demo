# webpack-demo

Just for not forgetting stuff

## So what's this?
Currently I was frustated on <strong>How can a browser JS file can be build on Node.js</strong>. I want to use SVG.js library unusual way (other than through cdn). After 3 hours of jumbling, I found that I need a web bundler.

There're many variety of web bundler, but this one (webpack) is the most popular.

You can pull this repo and adjust it to your need.
